This project is a backend service for an employee management application, built with Node.js, GraphQL, MongoDB, and Spring Boot. It provides functionalities to manage employee data, including adding, updating, and retrieving employee information. The project includes role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict certain actions to specific user roles (admin and employee).

Technologies Used
Node.js and Express for server setup.
GraphQL for API structure.
MongoDB for data storage.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and authorization.
Apollo Server for GraphQL integration.
Spring Boot (to be used if required as per setup).
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-management-backend.git
cd employee-management-backend
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set Up MongoDB Connection
Ensure MongoDB is running and set up in the .env file.

Configure Environment Variables Create a .env file in the root directory with the following variables:

plaintext
Copy code
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_database_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
Start the Server

bash
Copy code
npm start
Access the API
The GraphQL Playground will be available at http://localhost:4000/graphql.

Environment Variables
MONGO_URI: MongoDB URI for database connection.
JWT_SECRET: Secret key for JWT token generation and validation.
Usage
Use a tool like Postman or the GraphQL Playground to test the API endpoints.
Authenticate using a JWT token to access secured routes.
Admin and Employee users have different permissions (details below).
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
This backend service includes role-based access control to restrict actions based on user roles:

Admin: Can perform all actions, including adding, updating, and listing all employees.
Employee: Limited permissions. Can view their own details and update them if needed.
API Documentation
Queries
List Employees
Returns a paginated list of employees. Accessible by Admin only.
Get Employee
Fetch details of a specific employee by ID. Accessible by both Admin and Employee.
Mutations
Add Employee
Allows an Admin to add a new employee.
Update Employee
Allows Admin to update any employee’s details. Employees can update only their own details.
Example Query
graphql
Copy code
query ListEmployees($page: Int, $limit: Int) {
  listEmployees(page: $page, limit: $limit) {
    id
    name
    age
    class
    subjects
    attendance
  }
}
Example Mutation
graphql
Copy code
mutation AddEmployee($name: String!, $age: Int!, $class: String, $subjects: [String], $attendance: Float) {
  addEmployee(name: $name, age: $age, class: $class, subjects: $subjects, attendance: $attendance) {
    id
    name
    age
  }
}
Performance Optimization
Pagination and Sorting are implemented to handle large datasets efficiently.
Indexing: Consider adding indexes on fields frequently queried, such as name and age for faster access.
