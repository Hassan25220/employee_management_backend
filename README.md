Employee Management Backend
This project is a backend service for an employee management application, developed with Node.js, GraphQL, and MongoDB. It offers essential features for managing employee data, including adding, updating, and retrieving information. Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts actions to specific user roles, such as admin and employee.

Technologies Used
Node.js and Express for server setup
GraphQL for API structure
MongoDB for data storage
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication
Apollo Server for GraphQL integration
Spring Boot (if required)
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-management-backend.git
cd employee-management-backend
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set Up MongoDB Connection Ensure MongoDB is running and configured in the .env file.

Configure Environment Variables Create a .env file in the root directory:

plaintext
Copy code
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_database_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
Start the Server

bash
Copy code
npm start
Access the API at http://localhost:4000/graphql.

Environment Variables
MONGO_URI: MongoDB URI for database connection
JWT_SECRET: Secret key for JWT token generation and validation
Usage
Use Postman or GraphQL Playground to test API endpoints.
Authenticate using a JWT token to access secured routes.
Admin and Employee roles have different permissions.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Admin: Full access, can add, update, and view all employees.
Employee: Limited access, can view and update their own details.
API Documentation
Queries
List Employees: Returns a paginated list of employees (Admin only).
Get Employee: Fetches details of a specific employee (Admin and Employee).
Mutations
Add Employee: Allows Admin to add a new employee.
Update Employee: Allows Admin to update any employee’s details; employees can update only their own details.
Example Query
graphql
Copy code
query ListEmployees($page: Int, $limit: Int) {
  listEmployees(page: $page, limit: $limit) {
    id
    name
    age
    class
    subjects
    attendance
  }
}
Example Mutation
graphql
Copy code
mutation AddEmployee($name: String!, $age: Int!, $class: String, $subjects: [String], $attendance: Float) {
  addEmployee(name: $name, age: $age, class: $class, subjects: $subjects, attendance: $attendance) {
    id
    name
    age
  }
}
Performance Optimization
Pagination and Sorting: Handles large datasets efficiently.
Indexing: Recommended on frequently queried fields like name and age.
